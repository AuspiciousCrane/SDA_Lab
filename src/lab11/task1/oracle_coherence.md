# Oracle Coherence

---

## What is Oracle Coherence?
- In-memory data grid for data-intensive applications
- A distributed caching and data synchronization solution
- Is fast, reliable, and highly available
- Offers Event Processing and Event-driven capabilities

---

## Ok, But How Does It Work?
- Since it is **distributed**, it uses multiple nodes running a Coherence software in a grid architecture.
    - Each node contains a portion of data and changes to the data are propagated in real-time.
- These nodes will then work together to store and manage data in-memory to provide a single data store.
    - This makes data access have very low latency!

---

## Pros?
- High *performance* and *scalibility*
- Reduced load
- High *reliability* and *availibility*

---

## Cons?
- Not the best fit for small projects
- High learning curve
- Not cost-effective, considering there are alternatives such as **Redis** and **Apache Ignite** available

---

## Some Example Use Cases?
- E-Commerce: Since Oracle Coherence excels in providing *blazing* fast access to data, it is often used for inventory management.

---

## Conclusion
- In-Memory data grid and Distributed Caching solution
- Is distributed, fast, and reliable
- Offers high performance, scalibility, availibility, and reliability
- However, it also has a high learning curve, and may not be the most cost-effective for some companies
